# Stack Two : 
Stack Two takes a look at environment variables, and how they can be set.We can set environment variables using shell:
```bash
VAR_NAME=value
```
This is a local env variable that can not be by other process. For example, if we set `ExploitEducation` using the above method when we run `./stack-two` it will not find the variable to be able to use the variable we need to export it.
```bash
export ExploitEducation=Value
```
Now run `stack-two`
```
Welcome to Stack Two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Almost! changeme is currently 0x00000000, we want 0x0d0a090a
```
The different between this challenge and the pervious one is the input we have control of.The previous one we have control of the command line argument to the program, but now we have control over the env variable `ExploitEducation`. We need to make variable 64 character which is the `padding` plus `0x0d0a090a` which are the following ASCII character :

-  Carriage Return` : means to return to the beginning of the current line without advancing downward.This is commonly escaped as "\r", abbreviated CR, and has ASCII value 13 or 0xD.[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3091524/what-are-carriage-return-linefeed-and-form-feed)
-  Line Feed : means to advance downward to the next line; however, it has been repurposed and renamed. Used as "newline", it terminates lines (commonly confused with separating lines). This is commonly escaped as `\n`, abbreviated LF or NL, and has ASCII value 10 or 0xA. CRLF (but not CRNL) is used for the pair `\r\n`.

-  Horizontal Tab escaped as `\t` and has ASCII value of 0x09.

I used python to solve this level `solve.py`. Run the script:
```bash
python3 solve.py
```
